# StagerServer
A python flask server to serve payloads and generate one-liner stagers.

# Add your payload
Make a new directory in the "payloads" folder and call it whatever you want
your payloads name to be. 

You will need your payload file, and a file called "config.json".
You can find an example in "payloads/example".
